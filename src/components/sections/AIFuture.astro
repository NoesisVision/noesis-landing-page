                To build truly useful AI assistants, we need more than raw code — <strong>we need grounded, structured knowledge</strong>.

                Noesis extracts architecture, behavior and roles from real systems and turns them into a multi-perspective P3 ontology (People, Domain, Technology).
                This becomes the foundation for explainable AI, automation, and accurate documentation — all grounded in how your system actually works.
